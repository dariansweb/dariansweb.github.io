# Welcome to My Linux Certification Blog!

My name is Darian Ross and I'm a Linux enthusiast and certification blogger. On this site, I share my knowledge and experience in the Linux world and help others achieve their Linux certification goals.

## Linux Certification Overview

Linux is a popular open-source operating system used in various industries, including finance, healthcare, government, and education. Linux certifications are designed to validate the skills and knowledge of IT professionals working with Linux.

There are several types of Linux certifications available, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. Some of the most popular Linux certifications include:

- Red Hat Certified
  - [Practice Exams](/rh-exams/exam-listing.md)  (Coming soon!)

  - [Practice Exams](/lpi-exams/exam-listing.md)
    - CompTIA Linux+

      - This certification is a partnership between CompTIA and the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) and validates the same skills as the CompTIA Linux+ certification, but also includes LPI exam objectives.
